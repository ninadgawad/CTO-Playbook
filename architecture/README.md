# AI-Native Architecture Blueprint
Designing systems for the age of intelligent software.

## Overview

AI-native systems are not just applications with AI stitched on top — they are **fundamentally reimagined to leverage machine intelligence at their core**. This guide outlines architectural patterns and platform decisions that enable scalable, secure, and adaptive AI-powered systems.


## Core Principles

1. **Data-Centric Design**  
   AI-native platforms are driven by real-time, high-fidelity data streams. Invest in modern data infrastructure (e.g., data lakehouse, feature stores, vector DBs).

2. **Context-Aware Interfaces**  
   Use embeddings, semantic search, and agent frameworks to allow contextualized decisions and interfaces.

3. **Composable AI Services**  
   Expose foundation models, fine-tuned models, and decision engines as reusable services (via APIs or event-driven patterns).

4. **Continuous Learning Pipelines**  
   Automate feedback loops, retraining triggers, and model deployment for self-improving systems.

5. **Governance by Design**  
   Ensure bias monitoring, model auditability, and compliance (e.g., GDPR, AI Act) are built-in — not bolted on.



## Tech Stack Suggestions

| Area               | Tools/Frameworks                            |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| LLMs & APIs        | OpenAI, HuggingFace, LangChain              |
| Vector DB          | Weaviate, Pinecone, Qdrant, FAISS           |
| Orchestration      | LangGraph, Airflow, Temporal, Agentic DSLs  |
| Feature Store      | Feast, Tecton, Sagemaker Feature Store       |
| Observability      | Evidently AI, Prometheus, OpenTelemetry     |
| Governance         | Azure AI Monitor, MLflow, Guardrails AI     |


## Design Considerations

- Choose **open models** where explainability or privacy is critical.
- Implement **rate limiting and monitoring** on model endpoints.
- Add **circuit breakers** for fallback if AI responses fail.
- Use **human-in-the-loop** where decisions are high-risk.
