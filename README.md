# Leadership Playbook
A strategic guide to building scalable tech organizations, architecting resilient platforms, and driving innovation as a modern leader.

---

## Purpose
This repository captures my evolving thoughts, frameworks, and tools for navigating the Leadership role — from **platform architecture and AI adoption** to **org design, hiring, and innovation strategy**. It’s based on two decades of hands-on experience scaling products, people, and platforms.
